## Prompt Used

```txt
Create a React app called "F1 Favorites" - A Formula 1 Historical Data Dashboard
Build a clean, modern collaborative dashboard UI for displaying Formula 1 historical race data. This should look like a professional team collaboration tool (similar to Notion, Linear, or Figma) with beautiful design and intuitive navigation.
API Integration Requirements:

Fetch and display race sessions data from: https://openf1.org/#sessions
The app should be ready to integrate driver data from: https://openf1.org/#drivers
The app should be ready to integrate car data from: https://openf1.org/#car-data
Focus ONLY on displaying accurate race sessions in the main table - keep other sections static for now

Design Requirements:

Create a sleek, collaborative dashboard aesthetic with modern UI patterns
Use a clean color scheme with good contrast and professional typography
Include a sidebar navigation with sections for: Dashboard, Race Sessions, Drivers, Cars, Analytics
Design it as if collaboration features will be added later (think team-oriented layout)
Make it responsive and visually appealing

Main Page Requirements:

Display a prominent table showing historical F1 race sessions from the API
Include relevant session details like date, location, session type, etc.
Add search/filter functionality for the sessions table
Keep the design clean - don't overcrowd with too much data

Overall Structure:

Header with app branding "F1 Favorites" and user profile area
Left sidebar navigation
Main content area with the sessions table as the focal point
Use placeholder content for Drivers, Cars, and Analytics sections
Add subtle loading states and empty states

Technical Notes:

Use React with modern hooks
Implement proper error handling for API calls
Use Tailwind CSS for styling
Make the code clean and well-organized
Add comments explaining where collaboration features will be integrated later

Design Inspiration:
Think modern SaaS dashboard with collaborative team features in mind. The UI should feel premium, clean, and ready for team collaboration features to be added seamlessly.
Focus on getting the race sessions API integration working perfectly with beautiful presentation, while keeping other sections as well-designed static placeholders.
